# MODx Revolution

Been stuck with a bloated portal system that doesn't fit your site's mold? Tired of hacking away at existing CMSes to get things the way you want? Look no further: MODx is here.

The long-awaited MODx Revolution version power-packs all sorts of new features that the MODx community asked for, such as site contexts, improved caching, increased flexibility, transport packaging, a brand-new revamped manager interface and much more.

You asked. We listened. Here is our answer: Revolution.
